# Update-2

We have created the current version of TT based on microservices architure. This approach makes the application quite scalable both horizontally and vertically. However, it comes at a cost of adding commplexity to the system. This includes lots of tools and techniques which makes it difficult to contribute & deploy. While we can make the deployment process much easier, but unfortunately we are unable to make development easier and requires lots of experience with microservices.

It is important to keep scaling in mind, but after getting feedback from the community, we decided to migrate major parts of the application to a new much more simpler development architecture. This update aims at making both the deployment and contribution much easier. 

We will migrate the current main branch to a new branch, however we will not maintain it. It will be available if anyone wants to continue working on using and developing the microservices branch. We will maintain the only version hosted on trackterra.org .
