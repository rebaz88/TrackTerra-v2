# Grant Proposal: Funding for TrackTerra

- **Project Name:** TrackTerra
- **Team Name:** TrackTerra
- **Payment Address:** ————

## Project Overview

As you might already know TrackTerra is a tax and reporting application. It is build to ease the process of transforming the blocks/transactions data into a single transaction form similar to traditional banking systems. It currently supports native send/recieve, anchor, mirror(partially), pylon(partialy) and terraswap protocols.

### Overview

- TrackTerra – a tax focused blockchain explorer for Terra
- TrackTerra parsers transactions from terra wallets in to a format that can easily be imported in to popular crypto tax software.
- Removes the complexity and barrier to entry around reporting requirements for transactions in the terra ecosystem

### Project Details

The app uses nodejs and has it’s own database backend where it stored parsed transactions. Our MVP is mostly functional and can be demoed at beta.trackterra.org. Active development can be viewed [here](https://github.com/rebaz88/TrackTerra-v2/)

### Ecosystem Fit

- The target end users are users of the terra ecosystem that have any sort of tax reporting requirement, and crypto tax softwares that will either adopt our codebase or use our APIs. Crypto tax reporting is a major burden for crypto investors and this solution aims to solve this for the terra ecosystem.
- There is one competitor to trackterra which is stake.tax, however this solution is nearly unusable and doesn’t have support for many terra transactions. This solution is also not opensource. TrackTerra aims to build a solution that can easily be extended with little development effort that is also fully opensource.
